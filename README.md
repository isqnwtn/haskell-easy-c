A very simple example of how to use Alex and Happy to build a language
processor in Haskell.

# Building

To build this, you will need to install Alex and Happy. The easiest way to get
them is via Hackage:

$ cabal install alex
$ cabal install happy

## build using
$ cabal build

## run using
$ cabal run ./test/test.expr
